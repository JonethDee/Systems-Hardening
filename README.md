# Systems-Hardening

System Hardening and Information Security:
-Implemented system hardening techniques, leveraging tools such as STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides) and SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) to minimize vulnerabilities in technology applications, systems, and infrastructure.
-Reduced security risks by eliminating potential attack vectors and shrinking the system's attack surface through the removal of unnecessary software, closure of unused ports and services, restriction of account permissions, and application of secure configurations.
-Contributed to the development of secure software and protection of sensitive data by adhering to comprehensive guidelines on device configuration, server security, and data safeguarding.
-Utilized STIGs as the foundation for creating minimum security baselines, particularly for golden images used in configuration management.
-Ensured regulatory compliance with NIST security controls, aligning with STIG recommendations, when handling protected or sensitive data (e.g., PII, PHI, CUI).
-Provided a strong foundation for information system design by integrating system hardening practices into the development process.
